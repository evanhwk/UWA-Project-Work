<p></p>


Consider an operating system's
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160909220239/http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/lectures/lecture08/09.html">5-State Model of Process Execution</a>.
<br>
New processes are admitted to the system
and are immediately marked as Ready to run.

Each process executes, in turn, until it
<p></p>
<ul id="bullet">
<li> completes its execution
	(at which time the process Exits),
	</li>
<li> executes for a finite <i>time-quantum</i>
	(after which the process is marked as Ready
	and is queued until it can again Run), or
	</li>
<li> requests some input or output (I/O)
	(at which time the process is marked as Blocked
	and queued until its I/O request is be satisfied).
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

For this project we'll consider a simplified embedded operating system
in which only a single process occupies the single CPU at any one time,
and all I/O is performed using a single disk-drive.

Our operating system executes on a low-powered 1MHz processor,
with its internal clock advancing every one microsecond,
and all instructions taking one microsecond to execute.
<p></p>

Requests to perform I/O on the disk-drive suffer rotational latency,
as the required disk sector may not be under the single read/write head at
the time of the request.
Thus, disk I/O requests result in the requesting process being
Blocked until the required sector is available.
As our operating system is typically used in remote data-logging environments,
the integrity of the disk I/O is crucial,
and so every <i>write</i> request is implicitly followed by a <i>read</i>
request from the same sector to verify the data just written.
<p></p>

Between the execution of any two instructions,
the operating system determines which disk sector is currently
available for I/O (under the disk's read/write head).
All of the Blocked processes that have previously requested I/O
from the currently available sector are marked as Ready to execute,
and are queued until they can again Run.
<p></p>

Switching between states,
such as 'New &#8594; Ready', 'Ready &#8594; Running',
incurs no cost -
the global/absolute time does not advance,
and the processes involved do not accumulate any additional runtime.
<p></p>

<h3>Scenario files</h3>

Consider the following text file, which we'll call a <i>scenario file</i>.

Each line of the file contains a number of fields,
separated by one or more spaces or tabs,
and provides either a named constant, defining characteristics of the system,
or the description of a single event.
We may assume that the format of each scenario file is correct,
and its data consistent,
so we do not need to check for errors in the scenario file.
<p></p>

<pre>      timequantum  20000
      diskrpm      5400
      disksectors  64
      1100000      0      admit
      40000        0      read      18
      45000        0      read      20
      1600000      1      admit
      60000        0      read      12
      100000       0      exit
      30000        1      read      20
      80000        1      write     0
      1000000      1      exit
</pre>
<p></p>

Each event line (which begins with an integer) has a number of fields,
separated by one or more spaces or tabs.
<p></p>

<ul id="bullet">
<li> the first field provides a (non-negative) time,
	measured in microseconds.
	</li>

<li> the second field provides a (small, non-negative) process-identifier (PID).
	Events of type <i>admit</i> will always have a previously unused PID;
	all other events provide an existing PID.
        There will be at most 50 processes (0..49) in existence at once.
	</li>

<li> the third field provides an event type -
	it will always be one of
	<i>admit</i>, <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>, or <i>exit</i>.
	</li>

<li> the fourth field provides a (positive) integer
	which represents the required disk sector number for an
	I/O event.
	Only <i>read</i> and <i>write</i> events have this field.
	Individual processes will have at most 100 I/O events
	over their lifetime.
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

The time field for <i>admit</i> events represent an <i>absolute</i> time,
since the operating system rebooted.
In the above example,
processes 0 and 1 are admitted at time 1.1 and 1.6 seconds, respectively.
The time field for all other events represents a <i>relative</i> time -
a number of microseconds since the process was admitted.
In the above example,
process 0 makes I/O requests after/when it has executed for
40000&#956;s, 45000&#956;s, and 60000&#956;s,
and then Exits after a total execution time of 100000&#956;s.
<p></p>

<h3>Disk operation</h3>

The characteristics of the simple single-platter,
fixed-multi-head, disk drive
are defined in the scenario file.
The disk spins at a constant rate,
measured in revolutions-per-minute.

The disk has a number of sectors which can be considered as 
arcs radiating from the disk centre.
Sectors are numbered from 0 and,
when the machine reboots,
sector 0 is positioned under the head.
<p></p>

Each sector contains an identical number of data blocks and (pedantically)
a disk I/O request requires both a sector number and a block number to
identify the required disk location.
However,
because the disk head under which the disk spins is fixed,
our scenario files only need to provide the sector number.
For example,
a 20 sector disk spinning at 6000RPM,
would 'see' sectors 0,1,...19,0,1... in order
and would 'see' a total of (6000/60*20)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2000 sectors per second.
<p></p>

The disk can only perform read or write operations when the required sector
<i>first</i> becomes available.
For example,
if sector 28 has been under the head for a few microseconds already,
and another process now requests I/O using sector 28,
then that process will have to block and wait for
the disk to spin around until sector 28 again becomes available.
<p></p>

<hr style="text-align: center; width: 85%;">

<h3>Program requirements</h3>

The goal of this project is to develop and test a C99 program,
named <b>osevents</b>,
that reports three basic statistics about the 'mix' of events
in a scenario file.
The name of the scenario file is provided as the only command-line argument
to your <b>osevents</b> program.
Your program should terminate when all events have been "performed" -
after the last process has exited.

The statistics are all printed on a single output line,
separated by tab characters.
<p></p>

<ul id="bullet">
<li> the first statistic is the <b>total process turnaround time</b>,
reported in microseconds.
Each individual process's turnaround time is the difference between
the (absolute) time at which the process is Admitted
and
the (absolute) time at which the process Exits.

There is no need to additionally account for the time 
spent in the Ready or Blocked queues -
these will be "automatically" adding to the turnaround time as they simply

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<table><tbody><tr><td style="padding: 8px; background: #e6e6e6;">
    <b>The goal of this project</b> is to assess your understanding of
    introductory C99 programming language features,
    including its control-structures,
    simple data-structures,
    and its standard library support for string handling and text files.
    The project can be successfully completed using the information presented
    in CITS2002's lectures, laboratories, and tutorials,
    to the end of week-5.
<p></p>

Projects will be marked using an automatic marking program (for correctness)
and by visual inspection (for good programming practices).

It is thus important that your program produces its output in the
correct format.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p>

This project is worth <b>15% of your final mark</b> for CITS2002.
It will be marked out of 20.
The project may be completed <b>individually or in teams of two</b>
(working as a team is <b>STRONGLY encouraged</b>).
<p></p>

During the marking, attention will
obviously be given to the correctness of your solution. However, a correct
and efficient solution should not be considered as the perfect, nor
necessarily desirable, form of solution. Preference will be given to well
presented, well documented solutions that use the appropriate features of
the language to complete tasks in an easy to understand and easy to follow
manner.

Your program <b>must</b> employ sound programming practices,
including the use of meaningful comments,
well chosen identifier names,
appropriate choice of basic data-structures and data-types,
and appropriate choice of control-flow constructs.

Do not expect to receive full marks for your program simply
because it works correctly. Remember, a computer program should not only
convey a message to the computer, but also to other human programmers.
<p></p>

Your project will be marked on the computers in CSSE Lab 2.03,
using the OS-X environment. No allowance will be made for a
program that <i>"works at home"</i> but not on CSSE Lab 2.03 under OS-X,
so be sure that your code compiles and executes correctly on these
machines before you submit it.
<p></p>

<hr style="text-align: center; width: 85%;">

<h3>Submission requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li> The deadline for the project is
<b>12noon Friday 23rd September (end of week 8)</b>.
<p></p>
</li>

<li> Your submission will be compiled, run, and examined using the OS-X
platform on computers in CSSE Lab 2.03.
Your submission must work as expected on this platform.
While you may develop your project on other computers,
excuses such as <i>"it worked at home, just not in the lab!"</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;will
not be accepted.
<p></p>
</li>

<li> Your submission's C99 source file should each begin with the following lines:
<p></p>

<p class="shell">
/*
   CITS2002 Project 1 2016
   Name(s):		student-name1 (, student-name2)
   Student number(s):	student-number1 (, student-number2)
   Date:		date-of-submission
*/
</p><p></p>

If working in a team of two students,
only one needs to submit the project.
<p></p>

</li><li> <b>You must submit your program electronically using
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160909220239/https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/cssubmit"><i>cssubmit</i></a>.
No other method of submission is accepted.</b>
You should submit a single C source-code file
named <b>osevents.c</b>
to be assessed.
You do not need to submit any input test files
that you used while developing your project.

The <i>cssubmit</i> facility will give you a receipt of your submission.
You should print and retain this receipt in case of any dispute.
Note also that the <i>cssubmit</i> facility does not archive submissions and
will simply overwrite any previous submission with your latest submission.
<p></p>
</li>

<li> You are expected to have read and understood the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160909220239/http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">
University Policy on Academic Conduct</a>.

In accordance with this policy, you may <i>discuss</i> with other students
the general principles required to understand this project,
but the work you submit must be the result of your own efforts.
<b>
All projects will be compared using software that detects significant
similarities between source code files.
Students suspected of plagiarism will be interviewed and will be required to
demonstrate their full understanding of their project submission.
</b>
</li></ol>

<p></p>

Good luck!
<p></p>
Chris McDonald.
